🔐Password Manager using Python & Tkinter
A simple and secure Password Manager GUI application built with Python and Tkinter. This app allows users to generate strong passwords, store login credentials(website, email, password), and retrieve saved credentials using a search feature.

📌Features
- GUI Interface with Tkinter
- Random password generator with letters, numbers & symbols
- Secure storage of credentials in a local `data.json` file
- Search functionality to retrieve saved login info
- Error handling for missing files and empty fields
- Clean, user-friendly layout with proper alignment

This project helped me understand:
- Tkinter widgets (Entry, Label, Button, Frame, Canvas, etc.)
- Layout management using grid() and pack() together
- Python’s built-in json module for persistent data storage
- Random password generation using random, choice, shuffle
- Input validation and basic file error handling
